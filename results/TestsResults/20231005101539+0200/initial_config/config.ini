; Configuration File for UAV Camera Optimization

; Optimisation Algorithm Type:
; Specify the type of optimization algorithm to be used.
; Options: simulated annealing, genetic, simple local search, concorde, fast_tsp, tsp_solver2, solve_tsp_simulated_annealing, solve_tsp_local_search
; Default: concorde
optimization_algorithm = tsp_solver2

; Radius of UAV Camera Coverage Area (in meters):
; Define the radius of the area covered by the UAV camera.
; This value determines the effective coverage area of the camera.
; Default: 1000 meters
coverage_radius = 600
